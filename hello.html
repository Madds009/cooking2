Food, in the end, in our own tradition, is something holy.<br> It's not about nutrients and calories. It's about sharing.<br> It's about honesty.<br> It's about identity.If you really want to make a friend, go to someone's house and eat with him... the people who give you their food give you their heart".<br></p>

<P style="color: white;">There are several ways to make Chicken 65, the most popular styles being Hyderbadi, Andhra, and Indo-Chinese. This is the style I've seen at most restaurants. The chicken is deep fried after it's marinated in yogurt, ginger, garlic, curry leaves, and spices. It's then tossed in a dry spicy tadka for additional color and extra crisp. Let's not forget my favorite part - the delicious, crunchy curry leaves in the tadka.</p>

<P style="color: white;">Vadai is one of the important dishes prepared along with sweet pongal for Pongal festival as an offering to God. Vadai is always best served when it is hot and makes a lipsmacking combination with sweet pongal.Rinse urad dal a couple of times in fresh water. Then soak the lentils for 4 hours or overnight. Grind or blend the soaked lentils to a smooth batter with water. If the batter becomes watery, then the instant relief would be to add some semolina or urad dal flour or rice flour to it.</p>
